# What is Hoptoad?

[Hoptoad](http://hoptoadapp.com) is a service that &#8220;collects errors
generated by other applications, and aggregates the results for developer
review.&#8221; In addition to aggregation, you also get:

* Notification by email and/or RSS
* &#8220;Dupe detection&#8221;
* Lighthouse integration
* and a few other neat features

## What does this module do?

The Hoptoad module catches the exceptions generated by your app and submits
them to Hoptoad via the [Notifier
API](http://help.hoptoadapp.com/kb/api-2/notifier-api-version-2). Exceptions
will be passed through to the previously defined exception handler, so any
custom exception handler you have defined will still work.

## How do I make it work?

* Register for an account at [Hoptoad](http://hoptoadapp.com) (They offer a
  rate-limited, single project plan for free)
* Create a new project in the Hoptoad account manager
* View your project, and make note of the API key
* Copy the configuration file to your application config directory, and
  update the config with your API key
